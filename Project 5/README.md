# Online-Store

## Project description
```
This is a simple online store where the user gets to add or remove items from 
the bag and modify the quantity he's going to buy. The "check" is shown in the 
"Shopping Bag" view. In addition, the items in the bag are store in Local Storage.
It may be similar to Project 1, but this uses Vuex
